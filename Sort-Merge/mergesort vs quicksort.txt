Typically, merge sort wouldn't be used over quick sort (to sort a given array)
as quick sort has lower space complexity (O(1)) while typically having the same
time complexity (O(n*logn)).
    
The primary cases to use merge sort over quick sort are:

1) A lower time complexity (worst case: merge sort - O(nlogn), quick sort - O(n^2))
needs to be ensured. This can be especially important if nothing is known about the
data and/or the data needs to be sorted for real-time performance.

2) A stable sort needs to be used to maintain the same elements and their positions
in the original array; merge sort doesn't modify the original array and instead
creates a new sorted array while quick sort performs all sorting on the original array.
